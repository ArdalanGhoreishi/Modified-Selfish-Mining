# Modified-Selfish-Mining
This repository features the implementation of a modified Selfish Mining technique and two intelligent defense systems recently proposed by us. The objective is to mitigate the risks associated with Selfish Mining and Double-Spending attacks in the Blockchain.
Feel free to peruse our paper by clicking on the following link.
[New intelligent defense systems to reduce the risks of Selfish Mining and Double-Spending attacks using Learning Automata.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00529)

In this repository, we have incorporated the implementations of NikDefense, AVDHLA, and SVDHLA, developed by [Ali Nikhalat-Jahromi](https://github.com/AliNikhalat). All of the mentioned were originally proposed by Nikhalat-Jahromi et al.
